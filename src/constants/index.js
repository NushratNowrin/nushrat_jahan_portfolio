  export const aboutMe = "Introduce myself as a dedicated MERN developer. I have been interested in the Web Development sector since 2020, when I just completed my 2nd year in the Information and Communication Technology Department at Islamic University, Bangladesh. I wanted to be a Full-Stack Developer. Since then I have continued to self-Learning through various resources. Due to my keen interest, today I am qualified to introduce myself as a Junior Full Stack Developer. The path wasn't easy for me. I encountered many stumbling blocks on this long journey. The journey was disrupted temporarily but didn't stop. There is still a long way to go and more to learn. I am just on my way to fulfill my dream. I'm skilled in React.js, ES6, JavaScript, MongoDB, Node.js, Express.js, Firebase, Tailwind, Bootstrap, CSS3, and HTML5. I also have a reputation for time management, Unique Idea creation, and good communication."
